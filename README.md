# minecraft-scale-calculator - distance to blocks

This calculator can convert a distance into a number of blocks in Minecraft by rounding to the nearest meter and using a blocks per meter scale.

## What is this?

This was originally created for the Minecraft campus project at Lancaster University run by the [Innovation Hub](http://innovationhub.lancaster.ac.uk). It has now been rewritten as a simple AngularJS app built on [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/).

## Demo
